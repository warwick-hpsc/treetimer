Licensing:

Most of this code was written from scratch at the University of Warwick.

(a) Ichneia/PMTM (AWE/Tessella?):
	The use of F2C along with wrappers to generate a fortran interface (although the interfaces themselves are from scratch)
	are based on the Ichneia/PMTM timing library which seems to be a AWE/Tessella Plc item. This would include an entry in the
	Makefile on using F2C.
	It may or may not be distributable without a license, although fortran wrappers could be written by hand if desired.

	The system timers directly taken from the Ichneia/PMTM library (AWE/Tessella) - the relevant files can be found
	at include/timing_library/measurement/timers/tt_systimers_linux.h and src/timing-library/measurement/timers/tt_systimers_linux.cpp.
	However, these can be easily substituted with a different timer implementation if desired.

(b) JSON parsing is included from jsoncpp (https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp). The files for this can
	be found under include/third-party/jsoncpp/ and at src/third-party/jsoncpp/jsoncpp.cpp
    
    JSONCPP uses the MIT license for this, though if there is an issue with this license another JSON parser could
    potentially be substituted.

	The JSON functionality was intended to be for writing out data, although it is not currently implemented (or at least
	hasn't been used in some time if functional) so it may be possible to remove if desired. It was intended to be a more
	portable replacement for SQLite, since it could be destributed as two headers rather than requiring an SQlite library
	if needed.

(c) The TreeTimer library uses SQLite. This may pose distribution problems.
